I'm just a software developer who likes to help trainees, juniors and everybody who doesn't have a lot of experience in programming to start their journey in that gorgeous world :)

I know how it is difficult to start. When I started to learn programming, the most difficult thing for me was to choose a right task. "What application to write? And how?". I asked these questions every day. Thus, my goal is to give you an ability to become a successfull developer through solving practical tasks that can be added to your portfolio.
